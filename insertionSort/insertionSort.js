/**
 * Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm. Insertion sort
 * iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
 * It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point,
 * where that element belongs. It does this until it gets to the end of the array.

// Example usage:
// insertionSort([2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 9, 3, 8]); // yields [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

const insertionSort = (array) => {
  // Your code goes here. Feel free to add helper functions if needed.
  return array;
};
