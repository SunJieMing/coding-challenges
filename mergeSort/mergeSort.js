/**
 * Reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort for more detail about how this sorting algorithm works.
 * Sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.
 * First divide the list into its smallest unit (arrays with a single item in them)
 * Then compare each element with the adjacent list and combine them in the proper order.
 * Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
 * [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
