/*
 * Design a full-stack application for managing a restaurant.
 * Pay most attention to how you would design your mongoose schemas.
 * You should have a schema for a customer, waitress/waiter, each dish,
 * a schema for the full order, a schema for a cook, etc.
 * Create a diagram for how these would interact and how this application
 * track and coordinate effors between all of the restaurant staff.
 * 
 * If you get into designing the client then think of how a tablet app
 * at each table could allow the customers to order or how a web application
 * would allow people to make reservations, etc.  Always be thinking of how
 * these would influence the design of the underlying data relationships.
