Create an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a script.js file.

Add jQuery to your application.  You can use either a CDN or you can download the script file and place it in this folder.

Use HTML/CSS (You can use flexbox) to display 12 red squares on the page.

Use jQuery to make it so that when you click on one of the red boxes that box turns blue.

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with how to link together html files, stylesheets, scripts, and scripts from a CDN.
